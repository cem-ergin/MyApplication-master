)

Flavia and Swedish datasets were used for leaf recognition. The k-NN and SVM algorithms were used as the classification method.

## Installation

After you download and unzip the project, you must enter the Android Studio IDE and run it in the project directory. After running it, you must allow the program installed on your phone to access your files.

## Usage

In the local classification process, which is the first of the three tabs seen at the bottom, you can press the camera button at the bottom right to take a photo or you can classify a leaf image from your gallery. If you want to classify with the server, the server must be turned on.
